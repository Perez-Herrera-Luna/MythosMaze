  greeting: Hello there, I believe introductions are in order. Some call me the Ferryman,
    others call me the Rower. You may call me Charon.
  charIntroduction: It may have come as a surprise to see the undead all out and
    about. The reason being, is that I have lost my oar. Without it, I cannot bring
    them to the underworld.
  questIntroduction: I shall offer you a deal. Find my oar within the maze and bring
    it back to me. You shall be rewarded for your efforts.
  activeQuestNoItem: You dare to return before me empty handed?
  itemRetrieved: Ah, you found it. Well done.
  weaponIntroduction: And here is your reward as promised.
  questComplete: I bid you farewell and good luck on your journey throughout the
    maze.   Would be a shame if we meet again.
